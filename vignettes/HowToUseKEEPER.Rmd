# Introduction

KEEPER is a R package that outputs a csv file with patient profiles for phenotype validation.

## Assumptions:
- You have instantiated a valid cohort in a cohort table.
- You have access to person level data in the OMOP CDM V5.x + format on a database.
- You only need read access to the person level data. But you should have privileges to join the cohort table in the cohortDatabaseSchema with the person level data in the cdmDatabaseSchema.
- You have installed R and R-studio as described in the [Book of OHDSI](https://ohdsi.github.io/TheBookOfOhdsi/SqlAndR.html)

cohortDatabaseSchema: Schema name where your cohort tables reside.
cdmDatabaseSchema: Schema name where your omop cdm tables with person level data reside.
